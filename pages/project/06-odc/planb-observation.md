Our group is working on the tablet medications topic. Our foci for individual prior art observations are specialized and distinct so we can gather as much information around the project as possible. We will then aggregate our findings and discuss them collectively.

For this observation, we focus on: **what is the environmental impact of the storage and delivery of tablet medications?**
****

We'll look at plan B pills. They come in the typical blister packaging but with an abnormally large amount of waste for some safety reasons. They're worth analyzing for their significant biological effects on the user and the environment, and the trade-off between these effects. Of course, more observations will be done related to the focus question, but we can only contain so much in a 500 word report.

Here are the plan b pills. The product is created by Plan B® intended to use it as emergency contraception (for biological females). It's a tablet of packed chemicals that perform its functions. The pill shall be administered orally. This particular box was found in a drug store in Waterloo — I was wandering around and was shocked by a big blue box wrapped in such a large amount of plastic so I checked it out. It cost me more than $40. (That's two whole hours of labor!)

It's a big box (around 5-10 cm width, 10-15 cm height,  3-6 cm depth) wrapped in a big sheet of the plastic outer packaging. It contains sheets of paper for instructions, caution, and medical information, as well as one (1) tablet of thickness ~3-5 mm and diameter ~8 mm in a high surface area blister packaging.

I will contrast possibly wasteful elements of the design against the safety reasonings behind them, then discuss any potential improvements.

### (Somewhat) Reasonable
##### That it only contains one pill
According to the caution sheet, taking plan B pills can lead to significant negative responses (such as vomiting, hormone changes, and emotional struggles) and should not be taken more than a few times. Some options provided by the same company contain two pills in one box. It's reasonable for a designer to include this number of pills for emergency use since medical professionals encourage using safer and more stable contraception over plan B.

##### The big sheet of paper
This is not wasteful because it has important documentation on the tablet for legal and safety reasons (eg what should you not do to make sure the pill is effective) in multiple languages. Not only are manufacturers legally required to include such documentation, but the sheet of paper also makes sure users can have the information they need. The text is accessible in terms of color contrast: it is black text on white paper in a very readable font. The font size is very small, making this aspect a little non-accessible. However, with most designs, this is an example of a trade-off. The designer had to balance between accessibility and waste reduction.

##### The material of the box & The plastic on the outside
The box is made of some paper-like material which is very fragile. The plastic ensures that the box is not tampered with, but the size of the box significantly increases the amount of plastic needed. Designers can replace this protective layer with biodegradable plastic, or use stronger materials for the box. For safety reasons, it's good that designers are 
- ensuring the pill is not easily stolen (by having a box) because the pill makes the manufacturer lots of revenue
- ensuring the pill is not tampered with (by having the plastic) because a tampered package with any decreased dosage or missing information can lead to significant medical consequences. 

##### The size & material of the blister packaging
The blister packaging was once very innovative because they prevent the pills from being tampered with, both before and during retail. They came in plastic to decrease errors in dosage (eg powder sticking on the walls of, say, packaging the chemical bonds with the pill contents). Blister packaging also allows easy and dosage-accurate administration. However, plastic and foil packaging at such a large surface area for a single pill seems very unsustainable. From a UX point of view, a large blister package makes the pill easy to find and difficult to escape the box. We can solve both of the size problems (the box and the pill package) by making the box smaller. 

The bumps on the blister packaging also prevent the pills from slipping out of the box. It increases surface area and plastic use but prevents misplaced medicine. One could keep these bumps using biodegradable blister packaging, redesign the outer box to decrease slipping through cracks, or have reusable blister packaging (see below).

**Reusable blister packaging**

Ideally, plan B is not to be reused. However, we could decrease the amount of thrown-away blister packaging by having some digital dosage dispenser (to ensure accuracy and decrease human error) at the drug store/pharmacy and a reusable packaging of smaller size. Many pills are already contained in biodegradable containers (the soft pill cases that we swallow the whole medicine with).

### I cannot reason these
##### The size of the box
The box is huge for its contents. Besides the waste products as described above, another side effect is that the large box makes the pill hard to hide. Society is shifting away from being embarrassed about contraceptives, but some still feel embarrassed to carry a big vibrant blue box with large labels "plan B." This could be intended by the designer, as part of efforts to encourage more reliable methods of contraception over plan B. 

When we shrink the box, the surface area also shrinks. The main side of the box has large labels that make them easy to identify but notice that the side contains already extremely small text — very inaccessible and hard to read. Again, most chemicals have this kind of densely packed information for safety and legal reasons. However, I've once observed a soap bottle that had a re-sealable peel flap on one side so that side can contain three pages of information in larger text, instead of one page. It would have more important safety information on the first page and less urgent information like subsequent pages. If we do shrink the box, we can incorporate this kind of information display to ensure user safety while reducing waste.

### Larger problems
Not much the designer's fault, but relevant to any solution design.

##### The price
There are two main factors for the high price:
- As mentioned before, there is an [active effort](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/27/morning-after-pill-expensive-high-street) to encourage people to choose stable and healthier (ie doesn't cause terrible side effects) contraceptives.
- Contraceptive demand is very inelastic (the more inflexible people are with their choice of purchase, the higher the retailer/manufacturer can price the product). One would notice that condoms are also very costly, plan B more so. 

The current state is that plan B pills cost far less to produce than the price it is marketed at. If we somehow strip away capitalism (which seems very difficult), designers would have more room and budget to incorporate sustainable designs into the tablet packaging and administration. For example, the peelable flap described earlier requires specific chemical properties in the material to make the flap peelable and re-sealable. Or, the material for more sustainable box packaging could cost more than the current basic paper and plastic package.
