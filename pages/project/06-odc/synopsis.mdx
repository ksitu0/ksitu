**Problem**: How might we use circular economy principles to rethink the storage, delivery, and dispensing of tablet medication?

**Solution**: A **policy brief proposal** that encourages relevant parties to employ circular economy principles so they can tablet medication waste while adhering to safety guidelines.

*Project Deliverable*

**Target Audience**: Health Canada HPFB (Health Products and Food Branch). Project Deliverable is designed to demonstrate the problem and our solution to a larger audience.

**Design Criteria**: 
- Any storage method must adhere to the strict drug-safety guidelines. 
- We want to have notable impact on people who can make decisions. We intend to specifically encourage circular economy principles, instead of, for example, monetary punishments. 
- Even though consumers are not a part of our target audience, they are a stakeholder. We want to give them incentive to support more sustainable drug products. 
- A balance between human desirability, economic viability, and technological feasibility

I think we met our criteria fairly well. Scroll down to read article "Synthesizing information to avoid the Swedish Bad Lion: Applying Critical Thinking Skills."

**Cool things I learned**

*Question Formulation Technique!*

It really helped me identify gaps in knowledge and be able to think critically about my assumptions and "unkown unknowns."

*Theory of Change!*

This way of thinking was particularly impactful for our problem. We were asked to "rethink" tablet medication, but it was very difficult to determine what we wanted to rethink. Theory of Change synthesizes the atomic aspects of the desired result and their corresponding solution paths, hence presenting the problem in a "big picture" and gives clear pointers to our next steps. I see myself using this technique in future projects when I am stuck.
