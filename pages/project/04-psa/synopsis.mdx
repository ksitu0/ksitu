**Objective**: We aim to create a PSA so that UWaterloo food service consumers can be informed of and take action for more sustainable food choices. 

**Client**: UWaterloo Sustainability. Our design supplements UWwaterloo Sustainability's create awareness and inspire UW staff and students to make sustainable food choices.

*Our PSA*

A tasty, colorful picture grabs **attention**. Green-red and 0-1 dichotomies inspire **interest**. To non-vegetarian readers, "for 1 meal" sounds easier than full vegeterianism. This and the tasty image evoke **desire**. Environmental incentives and statistics prepare the reader to take **action.** (AIDA Framework: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

*Our Prototypes*

**Design Criteria**: 
- Meet display specifications.
- Target UWaterloo students and staff.
- Human-centered digital design (eg plain white is harsh on the eyes).
- A huge fraction of UWaterloo students/staff are not aware of sustainable food options, so we will target this demographic.
- AIDA Framework

**Cool things I learned**

*Conflict Management*

I exercised lots of conflict management in this project. 
1. I found it helpful to care for each other's feelings by giving "vaccines" to potential conflicts. 
2. I collated everyone's opinions onto one platform and accounted for all types of speakers by giving everyone their own chance to confirm the group's synthesis of their opinion is accurate. Many conflicts can be resolved once we express ourselves clear enough. 
    - We also had a design criteria. When we struggle to make decisions, the design criteria can often make decisions for us.
3. And when we can't, having an accurate picture of the floating thoughts allows everyone to construct accurate reasonings and arguments, hence resolving the conflict at a happier level. The final common ground might be better than all of the possbilities debated over.

Scroll down to read article "My favorite conflict resolution experience," where I dicuss my experience helping our group decide between two prototypes but ending on a resolution that was better than both prototypes.

*Routine Ideation -> Prototyping -> Evaluation -> Iteration*

Routines allow us to approach the problem more systematically. They lessen explanations and improvised adjustments to unexpected changes. Over our large amounts of ideation and many iterations, we documented our solution's growth very well. 

<div style={{position: "relative", width:"100%", overflow: "hidden", paddingTop: "75%"}}> 
<object data="/content-psa-brainstorm.pdf" type="application/pdf" style={{width:"100%", height:"100%", position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0}}>
  </object>
</div>
*Our ideation*

A wellformed cycle of Ideation -> Prototyping -> Evaluation decreased the unpredictability in our project. As my first design thinking project, the routine cycle was especially helpful for adjustment. We had asynchronous feedback/commentary elements to our cycle we I found helpful for working together remotely.
