### In this section I speak in a very abstract way
I consider design thinking as an exploration, often an exploration of the solution space. Design thinking applied to personal life is an exploration of possibilities. More concretely, I believe that design thinking is more than its set of rules and its toolkit. It is a pathway on which we can explore the possibilities of a problem.

Over the INTEG 121 (Collaboration, Design Thinking, and Problem Solving) course, my most-improved design thinking skill is perhaps my ability to notice the previously overlooked, including:
- interdisciplinary connections *(eg. Ulrich's problem hierarchy and its relation to what programmers call the stack of tasks)*
- details *(eg. why my vacuum "on" button is so far down the shaft)*
- nuances in the "why" and the "what if" *(eg. the questions I ask people about their lives become increasingly introspective for them. I've been getting a lot more "Hm I've never thought about that before.")*

A cognitive exploration like design thinking involves expanding our scope of "knowns" and realizing more information about our scope of "unknowns." The prototype/iteration cycles of design thinking encourage us to not let go of any little details, constantly questioning what we are missing. It's like a mini ideation session on possible cognitive biases!

### Overview of what I'm saying

Often, "design thinking" comes into mind along with "innovation." Innovation is about realizing things about reality, synthesizing the situation into a solution, and implementing this solution. There is more to reality than what we think there is, and design thinking is about 
1. navigating this large space of reality,
2. collecting small fragments of it (as human senses are not omniscient), 
3. piecing together the fragments,
4. redirecting ourselves towards a more desirable new direction

In addition, design thinking offers a toolkit of different techniques to piece together our fragmented images of the world, which gives our brains multiple ways to view the information. The formal term for this is elaboration. Elaboration on something about a world, a solution space, or a concept helps us reach a deeper understanding.

### Example time

#### [The PSA Project](/project/04)
During difficult decision-making, our group members systematically gathered each other's opinions (2) and ensured everyone was on the same page by putting all their thoughts onto the same platform (3). In doing so, we each thought about the decision candidates in new ways and ended up coming up with a resolution that was neither of the candidates, but better than both. This extra possibility that no one thought of is a result of our exploration of the solution space.

#### [Rethinking Tablet Medication](/project/06)
None of our group members knew much about our initial problem space, let alone the solution space. Through design thinking and its toolkit of different ways to synthesize our research, we all learned a lot about the pharmaceutical industry, drug regulations, and circular economy principles. Design thinking deepened our understanding of the world by guiding us through a problem.

#### Overall
I consider that exploration through design thinking yielded more personal cognitive growth in my second project than in the first. In fact, in the first project, we didn't research much about the problem space compared to the second project because we considered ourselves very familiar with the problem. That's a red flag: confidence makes it easier to overlook flaws. From this, I've since developed a habit of exploring (design thinking) more carefully and systematically. Explorations are still full of freedom, like brainstorming, question formulation technique, and experimentation. Design thinking is a skill with which one can explore the world in a naturally punctilious way. I have yet to master this skill, but activities like regular observations help.

Based on the trend from the PSA project to the Tablet Medication project, I strive to approach problems in a more freely-thinking but attentive manner.

### Recap & Beyond INTEG 121
The bigger picture of design thinking is more than its set of rules. Some rules can be violated, like in [our project about tablet medication](/project/06), but design thinking is really a loose guideline for evaluating situations and updating our model of the situation. A novel solution is a new addition to our map of the solution space, which we may want to implement in real life.

Like how we can discover "unknown unknowns" in solution spaces, I've found design thinking particularly impactful in giving me new perspectives on life. For the first time, I had enough responsibility that I had to prioritize things. It is a design problem of 
- What academic goals should I set? Based on this term, what should my goals be for next term?
- How much social and personal life do I want? What matters to me?

Like many common corporate design problems, applying design thinking to life involves exploring different possibilities and trying different things to figure out what goes into our design criteria, what can evolve as a prototype, and what is [blank]?

Design thinking is an exploration of the world, adding to and drawing from "What matters in solutions?" and "What matters in life?"
