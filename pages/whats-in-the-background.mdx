## It's a graph!

Of my life notes made using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

Maybe I'll publish them sometime in the future. These notes consist of information I might find helpful in coming years. I use it for its graph feature, where I can link together different concepts. I can connect random ideas with life experiences or professional experiences. It's very fun! I also use it to record daily journals and observations of things around me. The formal term for this is "knowledge management system." You should look into it.
